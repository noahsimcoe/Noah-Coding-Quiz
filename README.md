# Noah-Coding-Quiz - Web API's
Challenge 04 - Web API's

## Description
This project is a timed coding quiz that I created. Scores per each user are stored at the end of each quiz (after you submit your initials), and they are based off of the amount of quesitons completed correctly and the amount of original time left. If the user answers a question incorrectly, they will get no points for the question and will have 15 seconds deducted from their time. If the user's time runs out before they finish answering quesitons, the quiz will automatically stop and score based off of the amount of correctly answered quesitons thus far.

I built this project to demonstrate that I could create a website from scratch that contains dynamically updated HTML and CSS that is powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and repsonsive user interface that allows the user to hover over and choose different answers to the randomly selected questions. In this project I demonstrated my ability to store/retrieve items from local storage, to set up interval functions, and to add funcitonality through event listeners. On top of all of these skills, I also showed through my code that I'm able to follow DRY principals, by simplifying my code through the creation of functions, where executable segments are repeated multiple times throughout the application.

In this project one of the main things I learned was the important of patience when creating a bigger application from scratch. This was the largest application I've created so far, which made it very daunting towards the beginning when I was just getting started. Practices like blocking out the code into smaller segments or creating descriptive comments really helped me work around this problem, and it made the task itself seem a lot more doable to me. I also learned the importance, as mentioned above, of trying to practice DRY (don't repeat yourself) as much as possible. I caught myself a few times writing the same segment of code multiple times, and I was luckily able to recognize that pretty early and turn those segments into functions that can be easily passed over and over. 

## Installation
This project is deployed on GitHub Pages and available to view.

## Usage
This project can be used to test your knowledge of some of the entry-level coding concepts that I've learned within the first month of my coding bootcamp.

## Deployed Application
Here is the link to access the deployed application.
